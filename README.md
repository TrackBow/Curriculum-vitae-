# 📄 Static HTML/CSS Resume Project

This project is a personal online resume created entirely with **HTML5** and **CSS3**. It was one of my early projects to practice and demonstrate foundational web development skills, focusing on translating a traditional document layout into a structured and styled webpage.

### ✨ What this Project Demonstrates

*   **Semantic HTML Structure:** The page is logically organized with distinct sections for the header, main content (experiences, education, skills), and footer.
*   **CSS Styling from Scratch:**
    *   A custom two-column layout to separate main information from side details (skills, languages).
    *   Styling for typography, colors, spacing, and links.
    *   Use of `div`s and classes to create a reusable and maintainable structure.
*   **Integration of External Assets:**
    *   Local images for icons and profile picture.
    *   Integration of the **Font Awesome** library for scalable vector icons.
*   **Basic JavaScript Interactivity:**
    *   Clickable logos that redirect to institutional websites (`onclick` events).
    *   An embedded audio player (`<audio>` tag).
